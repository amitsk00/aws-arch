# Generic stuff


## Well architected framework

### 6 pillars

* Op Excellence
    * perform operations as code
    * make small, frequent, reversible changes
    * Refine Ops Proc regularly
    * Anticipate failures
    * Learn from all failures

* Reliability
    * Auto recover from failures
    * Test recovery process
    * scale horiz
    * stop guessing capacity
    * manage changes in automation

* Perf Efficiency
    * Democratize advanced tech
    * Go global in minutes
    * Use serverless
    * experiment more often
    * consider mechanical sympathy

* Cost Optimization
    * Implement Cloud Financial Management
    * adopt a consumption model
    * measure overall efficiency
    * Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
    * Analyze and attribute expenditure

* Security
    * Implement strong identity foundation
    * enable traceability
    * apply sec at all levels
    * automate sec best practises
    * protect data at rest and in transit
    * keep people away from data
    * prepare for sec events
    


* Sustainability
    * Understand ur impact
    * Establish sustainability goals
    * Maximize utilization
    * Anticipate and adopt more efficiennt hardware and software
    * use managed services
    * reduce downstream imapct of your cloud workloads


### Design principals

* stop guessing capacity
* Test systems at prod scale
* Automate
* Allow for evolutionary arch
* Drive Arch using data
* Improve using Game days

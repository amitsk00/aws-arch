## RDS

* relational / SQL
* six familiar database engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server

## Aurora

* relational / SQL
* compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL 
* Consider Aurora if your workloads require **high availability**

## Redshift

## DocumentDB (mongo)

## DynamoDB

* non-relational / NoSQL
* massively scalable, distributed
* on-demand or provisioned models
* `global table` is where we can have 1 replica in multiple regions


## Amaxon ElastiCache

*  high-performance, scalable, and cost-effective caching solution
* works with Redis, Memcached engines


* non-relational / NoSQL

## Amazon KeySPaces (Cassandra)

## Amazon Timestream

## Amazon Quantum Ledger Database QLDB

## Amazon Neptune

## DMS

* homogenous or heterogeneous
* S3 can b source or target, either
* AWS Schema COnversion Tool (SCT)
